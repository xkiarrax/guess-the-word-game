# guess-the-word-game
This is my first Javascript project to make a hangman-like game, minus the hangman. Guess the word.

# About
This is a classic game. It will be created in Javascript, as a way for me to practice the language. Eventually, I plan to build the hangman part to go with the game in the future, as my skills get better. Creating this repository will also help me learn git better. Two birds with one stone! BOOM!
